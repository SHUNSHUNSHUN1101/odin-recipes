      For the dough: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a food processor, pulse together the cashews, oats, coconut and dates until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer mixture into a bowl and set aside.

      Next, blend the bananas, freeze-dried strawberries and honey in the food processor until a paste forms, about 30 seconds. Once blended, add the date mixture and pulse together for 1 minute.

      Scoop out 2 tablespoons of the dough and form into an oblong ball with a divot in the center. Pinch the edges together slightly to “close the eye” but make sure not to seal them shut. Repeat with the remaining dough. Bake on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling
    </li>
    <li>
      For the filling: Whisk together the yogurt and wheatgrass powder in a small bowl. Transfer to a small squeeze bottle or pastry bag fitted with a small tip. After the Eye Holes are removed from the oven and cooled slightly, fill the divot in the center with the yogurt filling.
