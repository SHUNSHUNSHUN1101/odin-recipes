        Break down the heads of cauliflower by first removing any outer leaves, then cut off the stem. With the cauliflower upside down, cut the florets away from inner stem, removing any leftover stem still attached to florets.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring 4 cups water and 1 tablespoon of the salt to a simmer in a medium pot, then cook the florets and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the water, transfer to a food processor, then add the butter, vegetable broth, lemon juice and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Puree until mixture is smooth, then transfer to a round serving dish.

        Using a spoon or spatula, swirl the pesto around top of cauliflower mash to create the effect of Rickâ€™s portal. Drizzle with the crema for the final touch.
