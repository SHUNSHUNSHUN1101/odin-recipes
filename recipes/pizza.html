    <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <p>DOUGH:</p>
    <li>2 cups cashews</li>
    <li>1 cup old-fashioned oats (gluten-free if necessary)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded coconut, unsweetened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dates, pitted</li>
    <li>2 bananas</li>
    <li>1 cup freeze-dried strawberries</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hone</li>

    <p>FILLING:</p>
    <li>1 cup vanilla yogurt (nondairy if necessary)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon wheatgrass powder</li>
  </ul>  

  <p>Directions</p> 
  <p>
    Special equipment: a large straw or pastry tip
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> 
      Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.    
    </li>
    <li>
      Working on a well-floured surface, make a 1 1/2-inch ball of pizza dough, then press flat and spread into a circle. Place 1 teaspoon of the pizza sauce into the middle of the dough, then spread evenly over surface. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon of the mozzarella over on top.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a large straw or pastry tip, cut out about 7 mini circles of pepperoni from 1 regular slice, then arrange the mini pepperonis on the pizza. Next transfer the completed pizza to a parchment-lined cookie sheet and set aside. Repeat with the remaining dough, pizza sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the pizzas are assembled, bake in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to keep an eye on these, as they can burn quickly. Serve and enjoy.
